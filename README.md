## **Task B2**
- Mocha and Chai Testing
  
### Local Deployment

In this segment we will run and observe the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE API calls on a locally deployed web application using postman. In this example, we will use contacts, containing the name and email, as the model for our api calls.

1. Ensure that node.js is installed in your computer.

2. Run the app with the following command

        npm start

3. To access the automated api testing, run the following command 

        npm test

The appTest.js tests all API calls
